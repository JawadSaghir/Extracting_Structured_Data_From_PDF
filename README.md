📄 PDF-Based RAG System using LangChain

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that extracts text from PDFs and uses it to answer user queries intelligently.
Built using LangChain, it processes documents, creates embeddings, and retrieves the most relevant chunks during question-answering.

✨ Features
📥 Extract text from uploaded PDFs

🧠 Generate embeddings for document chunks

🔎 Retrieve the most relevant context based on user queries

🗣️ Generate answers using a language model (LLM)

⚡ Fast, scalable, and modular

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍
